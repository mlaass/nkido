You are optimising Cedar DSP opcodes with SIMD. Cedar is the real-time audio
engine of nkido: a bytecode VM that processes blocks of 128 float samples at
48 kHz, zero allocations on the audio path. The repository is your current
working directory.

## Task

Make these opcodes faster on **x86-64 AVX2** (the gate machine):

$opcodes

They live in `$file`. Current source of the opcode bodies:

```cpp
$sources
```

Baseline cost on the gate machine (median ns per opcode-block, lower is better):

$baseline

## How to add a kernel

The dispatch header `cedar/include/cedar/dsp/simd.hpp` is already there. Keep
the scalar body and add a kernel in front of it:

```cpp
#include "../dsp/simd.hpp"

namespace kernels {
#if CEDAR_SIMD_X86
CEDAR_TARGET_AVX2 inline void mul_avx2(const float* a, const float* b, float* out) noexcept {
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < BLOCK_SIZE; i += 8)
        _mm256_store_ps(out + i, _mm256_mul_ps(_mm256_load_ps(a + i), _mm256_load_ps(b + i)));
}
#endif
}

inline void op_mul(ExecutionContext& ctx, const Instruction& inst) {
    // ... resolve a, b, out ...
#if CEDAR_SIMD_X86
    if (simd::has(simd::Isa::Avx2)) { kernels::mul_avx2(a, b, out); return; }
#endif
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < BLOCK_SIZE; ++i) out[i] = a[i] * b[i];  // fallback stays
}
```

- `CEDAR_TARGET_AVX2` is `[[gnu::target("avx2")]]`; no compiler flags change.
  FMA is **not** enabled (it would change rounding).
- Buffers from `ctx.buffers->get()` are 32-byte aligned; `BLOCK_SIZE` is 128.
- You may also add NEON (`CEDAR_SIMD_NEON`) or WASM SIMD128
  (`CEDAR_SIMD_WASM`) paths; they are measured later on other machines, not
  gated here.

## Rules (enforced by the verifier — violations are rejected automatically)

1. You may only edit: $allowlist. Any other edit (benchmarks, tests,
   experiments, CMake, scripts) rejects the whole attempt.
2. **Never delete or change the scalar body.** It is the oracle and the
   fallback; the verifier runs it with SIMD disabled and requires
   bit-identical output to the original.
3. Output must be **bit-identical** to the original for every opcode.
   $approx_policy
4. No allocation, locks or syscalls in a kernel. CPU detection is already done
   once at start-up; never detect features per block or per sample.
5. The change must make at least one listed opcode **≥ 5 % faster** (outside
   measurement noise) and none slower.

## Checking your work

Run `$check_cmd` as often as you like. It builds, checks the allowlist and
bit-identity for every opcode, and runs a short benchmark (~1 minute). The
full verification after you finish also runs all unit test suites, the
zero-allocation trap, the opcode's DSP experiments and a longer benchmark.

When you are done, stop. Leave your changes in the working tree; do not
commit.
