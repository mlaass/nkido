You are optimising Cedar DSP opcodes with SIMD. Cedar is the real-time audio
engine of nkido: a bytecode VM that processes blocks of 128 float samples at
48 kHz, zero allocations on the audio path. The repository is your current
working directory.

## Task

Make these opcodes faster on **x86-64 AVX2** (the gate machine):

$opcodes

They live in `$file`. Current source of the opcode bodies:

```cpp
$sources
```

Cost on the gate machine (median ns per opcode-block, lower is better):

| Opcode | Original scalar | Current (accepted so far) | Speedup so far |
|---|---|---|---|
$baseline

## Accepted so far (already in the tree)

## How to add a kernel

The dispatch header `cedar/include/cedar/dsp/simd.hpp` is already there. Keep
the scalar body and add a kernel in front of it:

```cpp
#include "../dsp/simd.hpp"

namespace kernels {
#if CEDAR_SIMD_X86
CEDAR_TARGET_AVX2 inline void mul_avx2(const float* a, const float* b, float* out) noexcept {
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < BLOCK_SIZE; i += 8)
        _mm256_store_ps(out + i, _mm256_mul_ps(_mm256_load_ps(a + i), _mm256_load_ps(b + i)));
}
#endif
}

inline void op_mul(ExecutionContext& ctx, const Instruction& inst) {
    // ... resolve a, b, out ...
#if CEDAR_SIMD_X86
    if (simd::has(simd::Isa::Avx2)) { kernels::mul_avx2(a, b, out); return; }
#endif
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < BLOCK_SIZE; ++i) out[i] = a[i] * b[i];  // fallback stays
}
```

- `CEDAR_TARGET_AVX2` is `[[gnu::target("avx2")]]`; no compiler flags change.
  FMA is **not** enabled (it would change rounding).
- Buffers from `ctx.buffers->get()` are 32-byte aligned; `BLOCK_SIZE` is 128.
- You may also add NEON (`CEDAR_SIMD_NEON`) or WASM SIMD128
  (`CEDAR_SIMD_WASM`) paths; they are measured later on other machines, not
  gated here.

## Rules (enforced by the verifier — violations are rejected automatically)

1. You may only edit: $allowlist. Any other edit (benchmarks, tests,
   experiments, CMake, scripts) rejects the whole attempt.
2. **Never delete or change the scalar body.** It is the oracle and the
   fallback; the verifier runs it with SIMD disabled and requires
   bit-identical output to the original.
3. Output must be **bit-identical** to the original for every opcode.
   $approx_policy
4. The final verification also runs every opcode on **randomised stimuli you
   cannot see** (different signals, levels down to denormals, parameter
   trajectories). A kernel that only works for the stimuli in the benchmark
   source fails there.
5. No allocation, locks or syscalls in a kernel. CPU detection is already done
   once at start-up; never detect features per block or per sample.
6. The change must make at least one listed opcode **≥ 5 % faster** than the
   *current* version (outside measurement noise) and none slower.

## Budget

At most **$max_checks runs of the check command** and **$minutes minutes** for
this attempt. Every model in this experiment gets the same budget.

Your tools are: read, write and edit files, search the repository, and run
the check command. **The check command is the only shell command allowed**
(piping its output, e.g. through `tail`, is fine). You cannot run Python,
compilers or other scripts; do any numeric derivation (polynomial
coefficients, error bounds) yourself, and let the check measure it.

## Method

1. Read the code you need.
2. **Before editing, state your hypothesis in one or two sentences:** what
   bounds this opcode's speed (e.g. a serial feedback recurrence, a
   transcendental call, memory bandwidth, branches, VM overhead) and the
   single change you will make to address it.
3. Make **one focused change**. Do not repeat an idea from the attempts table
   below unless you fix the reason it failed.
4. Run `$check_cmd`. It builds, checks the allowlist and bit-identity for
   every opcode, prints compiler vectoriser remarks for `$file`, and runs a
   short benchmark (~1 minute). The full verification afterwards also runs
   the hidden stimuli, all unit test suites, the zero-allocation trap, the
   opcode's DSP experiments and a longer benchmark.
5. Stop. Leave your changes in the working tree; do not commit.

**Your final message must end with exactly one line of this form:**

```
IDEA: <bottleneck> -> <the change you made> (<what the check showed>)
```
