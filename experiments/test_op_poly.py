"""
POLY Opcode Quality Tests (Cedar Engine)
=========================================
Tests POLY voice allocation against the user-reported "incomplete chord" /
"hiccups every few bars" symptom.

These tests drive the user's actual `chord("C Em Am G") |> poly(@, stab) |> out(@)`
patch through the offline render pipeline (`nkido-cli render`), then analyze:

1. Voice trace (JSONL): every block, list of active voices with freq, gate, etc.
   - Detect "firing voice" count > 3 (more chord notes than expected)
   - Detect dropped chord notes (firing voice count < 3 mid-chord)
   - Detect voice leaks (active voices accumulating beyond expected)

2. WAV audio: detect "hiccups" — sudden level spikes, sudden silences, DC offsets.

3. Save WAV for human listening — the ear is the final judge.

If a test fails, do NOT loosen the threshold. Investigate the implementation in:
  - cedar/include/cedar/opcodes/dsp_state.hpp (PolyAllocState voice allocation)
  - cedar/src/vm/vm.cpp (execute_poly_block event processing)
